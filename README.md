Simulate HiDPI ("Retina") scaling on external displays that don't natively
report a HiDPI mode to macOS — with a "Looks like" resolution picker in
System Settings ▸ Displays, just like a real Retina panel.

Requires **macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later**. Older releases are not supported.

## Install

**Local** — clone the repo and double-click `retinafy.command`, or run it
from a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsdezen/retinafy.git
cd retinafy
./retinafy.sh
```

**Remote** — run directly without cloning:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsdezen/retinafy/main/retinafy.sh)"
```

(Icon customization needs the `icons/` folder next to the script, so the
local clone is the more complete option; the remote one-liner still works
for the core HiDPI injection.)

## Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:

1. **Enable HiDPI** — pick the external display, then choose how to derive
   the "Looks like" resolutions:
   - **Auto** — retinafy reads the display's current (native) resolution
     and generates the same spread of scale steps macOS computes for a real
     Retina display ("Larger Text" down to "More Space"), all locked to the
     display's real aspect ratio.
   - **Manual** — type your own list of resolutions if you want full
     control.
2. **Disable HiDPI** — remove one installed override, or reset everything
   back to the macOS default.

Reboot after enabling or disabling for the change to take effect. The boot
logo may look oversized on the very first reboot only.

## Safety

- Only writes under `/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides` — never
  touches `/System`, never requires disabling SIP, never installs a kernel
  extension.
- The built-in display is detected and excluded before any display list is
  ever shown — it cannot be selected, and nothing in this tool can write to
  its profile. Always double-check the display name printed before
  confirming, especially on unfamiliar hardware.
- Everything is reversible: use the in-app "Disable HiDPI" option, or delete
  `/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides` entirely.
- If a change ever leaves a display unusable, boot into macOS Recovery,
  open Terminal, and run the helper script generated at
  `~/.retinafy-disable` (or manually delete the folder above from the
  mounted system volume).

## The EDID compatibility patch

Some monitors drop to a lower resolution after sleep/wake when using a
plain override. retinafy can optionally patch a couple of feature-flag
bytes in the display's own EDID (embedded only in its override file — your
monitor's actual firmware is never touched) to work around this. It's only
offered on Intel Macs, since Apple Silicon has no real EDID to read in the
first place.
