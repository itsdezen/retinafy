# retinafy

Single-file bash tool (`retinafy.sh`) that injects HiDPI display-override
profiles into `/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides` on macOS 26+.

## Hard rules

- macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later only. No backward compatibility.
- Never write anywhere under `/System`. Only `/Library/Displays/...`.
- The built-in display (and any Apple-branded display, VendorID `0610`) must
  never be selectable or touched — this is checked before any display list
  is shown, not just at write time.
- `Icons.plist` is merged (via `PlistBuddy`), never overwritten wholesale —
  other displays' icons must survive untouched.
- English only, no i18n tables.
- Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS ships no newer bash by default): no
  associative arrays, no `${var,,}`, no `mapfile`.
- Watch for the `IFS=x arr=(...)` leak: it only scopes temporarily before a
  real command, not before a bare assignment. Use `local IFS=` or
  save/restore explicitly.

## Layout

- `retinafy.sh` — all logic.
- `retinafy.command` — double-click launcher, just calls `retinafy.sh`.
- `icons/` — bundled `.icns` device icons.
- `Icons.plist` — minimal fallback template, only used if the system has
  no `Icons.plist` of its own to merge into (shouldn't normally happen).

## Testing

No test suite. Verify by sourcing the script (`source ./retinafy.sh`) and
calling functions directly — the `main` entry point is guarded so sourcing
doesn't execute it. Never run the real `sudo` install path against this
machine's display without explicit confirmation.
